## what i want to accomplish with my application
 i need this internship to get more working experience in Embedded systems field also with XIOT as well known company it will give me the perfect experience and contacts 
 
 
 ## what I learned in the process
   First i was my first time to deal with virtual terminal i always send a char to another controller and dispaly it on LCD 
   
   
 ## My Experience in Embedded sysems 
 
 ``` 
 1- C/C++ and Data Structure
 2- Embedded C
 3- Interfacing with ATMEGA32 / TivaC / PIC / Arduino
 4- RTOS
 5- Devise Drivers
 6 -Modular Programming
 7- Knowledge in designing , developing and testing AUTOSAR device Drivers

```
 ## Projects in Embedded sysems 
 
 ``` 
1 - CAR(MULTIFUNCTION CAR) :
      Description:
        Multifunction RC Car with about nine sensors like (Flam , LDR , PIR LM35 , Bluetooth module and more)
      Tools :
        I used several controllers like (PIC16F887A , Arduino and Atmega32) the last one was my Graduation Project at EmbeddedFAB
2 - Smart Home
        (Security system using LCD and KeyPad for writing a password PID Sensor LM35 Ultrasonic Flame sensor Gas Sensor)
3 - Human counter
        using LCD , Atmega32 , PIR Sensor and Timer Module
4 - Fire-Alarm Using UART
5 - LM35 Interfacing with LCD
6 - Smart Door lock
        using LCD , Atmega32 and Keybad
7 - EEPROM interfacing with Atmega32
8 - RCT Interfacing

9 - Distance meter using Tivac :
      Description
          1. measure the distance using Ultrasonic
          2. display the result on Seven segment
      Tools :
          TivaC
```
